# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Analysis-Using-Regression

This repository contains code and analysis for predicting wine quality using machine learning models. We explore the UCI Wine Quality dataset, train various models, and evaluate their performance.

## Data

- The dataset consists of red and white wine samples.
- Features include acidity levels, alcohol content, and other chemical properties.
- Explore the data by visualizing distributions and correlations.

## Models

1. **Random Forest**
   - Hyperparameters: [Specify hyperparameters]
   - Performance: [MSE, R-squared, etc.]

2. **SVR with RBF Kernel**
   - Hyperparameters: [Specify hyperparameters]
   - Performance: [MSE, R-squared, etc.]

3. **Neural Network (Single Hidden Layer)**
   - Hyperparameters: [Specify hyperparameters]
   - Performance: [MSE, R-squared, etc.]

## Feature Importance

- We calculated feature importance using permutation importance and tree-based models.
- [Discuss which features are most important and whether they are consistent across models.]

## Cross-Model Testing

- Tested models on opposite wine type (red vs. white).
- [Comment on model generalization.]

## Usage

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git`
- Set up your Python environment (see `requirements.yml`).
- Run the relevant scripts (e.g., `train_models.py`, `evaluate.py`).
